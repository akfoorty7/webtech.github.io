Next, introduce one pound (450g) of ground beef to the pan, breaking it apart with a spoon and cooking it until it's no longer pink. Don't forget to drain any excess fat if needed. Now, incorporate a can of 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes and two tablespoons of tomato paste into the mix, stirring everything together. Season your sauce with a teaspoon of dried oregano, a teaspoon of dried basil, half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes (adjust to taste), and a pinch of salt and black pepper. If you like, pour in half a cup of red wine at this stage for added depth of flavor, although it's dinner optional. Reduce the heat to low, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. While the sauce simmers, cook one pound (450g) of spaghetti according to the package instructions until it reaches the perfect al dente texture. Drain the spaghetti and set it aside.
